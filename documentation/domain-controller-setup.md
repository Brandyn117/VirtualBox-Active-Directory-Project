# ðŸŽ® Domain Controller Setup

## VM Setup
After adding the ISO and configuring the necessary hardware specifications for the domain controller VM, I set the first network interface (NIC) to connect to my home internet. This NIC will serve as the external connection.

Next, I configured a second NIC for internal communication. This NIC is attached to an internal VirtualBox network and will be used to communicate with the client VM.
